- We made our website on google slides. We embedded the codes of our charts directly onto the website. We used Libraries 
such as highcharts, amcharts, zingcharts and matplotlib to plot all are charts. 

- The html files contain code for all the charts made using javascript. 
    - Score_diff.html - code for first chart 
    - map_chart.html - code for the second chart (Map one)
    - off_rank.html - code for 3rd chart
    - defense.html - code for the 4th chart 
    - play_by_play_analysis.ipnby - code for the 5th chart. 

- The Datascrape.ipynb notebook that contains my data scraping and data prepration code for the first 4 charts. 

- The play_play notebook cotains all my analysis for the play by play data for the 49ers and the rest of NFL teams. It 
also contains the code for my play_by_play chart (The 5th chart) 

- I could only upload one csv file as the rest of themw were too large for github. I have cited all the data on my charts, so you can acccees it from there directly.
