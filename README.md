Intro

- We made our website on google slides. We embedded the codes of our charts directly onto the website. We used Libraries 
such as highcharts, amcharts, zingcharts and matplotlib to plot all are charts. 

The html files contain code for all the charts made using javascript. 

The datascrape file is an ipythin notebook that cotains my data scraping and data prepration code. 

The play_play notebook cotains all my analysis for the play by play data for the 49ers and the rest of NFL teams. It 
also contains the code for my play_by_play chart 

I could only upload one csv file as the rest of themw were too large for github. I have cited all the data on my charts, so you
can acccees it from there directly.
